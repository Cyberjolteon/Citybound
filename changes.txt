betaALPHA's changes:

*Celestial & Navigation:
 *Keyword "populated" in a teal color, distinct from lush planets
 *3 unique text descriptions, as with other vanilla planets
 *Unique planet colors: teal-grey, grey, and pale green (with two old lush greens).
 *Removed as tier 1 type planets and moons (they were way too common relative to the vanilla 
  "lush" worlds). Are now tier II only

*Surface:
 *Hostile creatures removed
 *Increased number of attempted dungeons and updated the list to include some variety in races 
  (guarenteed human cities, removed outpost gates)
 *More critter variety (4) and the selection has changed (-bunnies, -bird, -snail, +vulture, 
  +squirrel, +gull)
 *Added cats and dogs! These are capturable and spawn in different colors on different populated 
  planets (simulates regional popularity?? lol)
 *No wild farmable plants
 *No unique terrain formations
 *cave generation should be sparse
 *Night lights have been adjusted to appear more realistic
 *Underground and surface asphalt patches, representing old roads and debris

*Game:
 *reset starting planet to the defualt "lush" type
 *New music for on the surface, both day and night (uses games own music files)


~~~~~~~~~~OUTSTANDING ISSUES~~~~~~~~~
 *The Hyotle underwater city spawns on the surface, but surrounded by water. Should make a new 
  structure and tweek it
 *The city lights should be looked at/passed over a couple times to ensure a good aesthetic look.


~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~IDEAS~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
*Reformat terain generation to make the land flatter/have less mountains
